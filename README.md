# x3n1a
x3n1a is an open-source browser. it strives to be simple, with the capability to provide the features of more mainstream browsers, but with a far more stripped-down core.

currently, it does not exist, and is bneing developed by a team of one. im rusty on my coding, and ikjm fully aware it will be nowhere near servicable for quie a long time, if ever. however, i dont really care, i just like making things.

no promises on this ever being functional
